# ChatBot
Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate human conversation. They have become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in businesses and customer service environments, as they offer a cost-effective and efficient way to interact with customers. With the rise of AI and natural language processing technology, chatbots are becoming more sophisticated and able to understand and respond to complex user inquiries.
This Project is about Chatbot which is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and use for basic conversation.
